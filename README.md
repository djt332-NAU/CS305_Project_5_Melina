# CS305_Project_5
For project 5
The purpose of this project is to create a GoLang analysis tool for transforming .txt files that contain cladogram tree data in newick format into standard format.

In this case, standard format is a 2D slice of int where the first element is parent nodeID, and the second element is nodeID.

Ex:
Newick Format:1( 2,3(4))

Standard Format:
1,1

1,2

1,3

3,4
